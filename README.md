# Train Schedule Database: 

I created a Firebase backed train schedule application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

I then used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
